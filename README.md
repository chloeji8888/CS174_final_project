Introduction

We will implement a vivid simulation experience mimicking the perspective of a ticket seller (or a mysterious viewer?) situated within a ticket booth at various randomly and procedurally generated events. This project means to explore the narrative potential of simple environments and attempt to demonstrate the great representability of inconsistent narrative structures.

Booth Perspective Sketch

1 - Shutters, 2 - Field of View, 3 - Table. The shutters will be interactable.

Algorithms to be Implemented

Lighting
Spline interpolation
Procedural generation
Basic physics
Material and shaders
Particles
Scenarios:

From the perspective of a ticket seller, one can see the outside environment changing randomly, so thereâ€™s going to be several scenes appearing in the view. In each scene, there will be walking/standing humans, running cars, etc. These elements will randomly appear in different scenes.
